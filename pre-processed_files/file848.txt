imo best way mount toms especially pearls session kit came heavy play maple toms never single issue tuning bouncing lug stress whatsoever think use take granted fully understand sturdy use another suspension system recently purchased pearl birch vision kit wife came pearl's mounting system fair i've never used case new kit came right optimounts went right even though aluminum expensive slightly lighter masterworks version feel work they're intended also accent drum shells without intrusive drummers buy skin play sound showing nice wood shells never hurts can't think single negative except they're free
