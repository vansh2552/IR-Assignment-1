i've playing years worried par mid end guitar i've using guitar looks feels great finish well done got warm full sound really enjoyed times found reluctant stop playing really pleased smooth fretting felt like took less effort move frets press several guitars i've played previously gripe fret position markers dots really dark hard spot see pictures that's deal breaker means since playing would normally look markers side neck pretty clear still aesthetically dark markers look nice overall quite impressed especially great price know guitar good encourages play often makes hard stop put
